Oak Perl Component Tree --------------------------

This is a set of modules that implement a tree of objects (based on Oak::Object)
that looks like the Delphi's VCL. The idea is to make a Complete tree (Including
support for GUI and WEB applications) to improve the RAD (Rapid Application
Development) in perl.

It's currently all in perl, but any language which can be embedded into perl
will be accepted.

The project is currently hosted at Sourcefoge, you can visit it at
http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/perl-oak


INSTALL ------------------------------------------

Follows any other perl library:
perl Makefile.PL
make install


DEVELOPMENT GUIDELINES ---------------------------

This module is just the base for all the tree. Follows some comments about how to
create an Oak Class.

. We are using the CPAN perlStyle, (almost) try to keep this.
. All objects in Oak are descendants of Oak::Object, so, read it's perldoc at first shot.
. Try to read the perldoc of all the superclasses of your class, it's very important
  when you override some methods.
. Nobody implements new, implement constructor instead, but nobody call constructor, call
  new instead.
. Error handling is made using Error module, check is perldoc to underestand what i'm
  talking about.
. That's it...
. Please contact me if you want to develop an Oak Object, if applicable your module will
  enter in the Oak main distribution.
